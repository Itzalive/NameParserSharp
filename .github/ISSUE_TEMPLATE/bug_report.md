**Library Version**
What version of [NameParserSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NameParserSharp/) are you using?

**Describe the bug**
What input are you trying to parse?

_Please make sure you're not publishing any [PII](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personally-identifiable-information-pii.asp) -- anonymize in such a way that the problematic behavior exists but can be included in test cases and your GitHub Issue._

**Actual & Expected behavior**
What is your actual and expected result? Ideally, include code that can be copied & pasted directly [into the test project](https://github.com/aeshirey/NameParserSharp/blob/master/NameParser/NameParserTest/NameParserTests.cs)

**Applicability**
Is your use-case unique, or is it likely to affect many other people?

Is there a general property of your input data that might help describe it or guide a resolution? (eg, input is guaranteed to have a first name; need to handle different last name prefixes than are standard)
